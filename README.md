# AWS SMS AMI Namer

At the release of this script, the AWS Server Migration tool creates AMIs, but it doesn't add a name tag. This script will take the VM name and then add it to the AMI.

**Disclaimer: I didn't add any UI/UX, so the script will run and add the VM names as soon as you run it. Use at your own risk.**
